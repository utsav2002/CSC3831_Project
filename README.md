This repository contains three parts of a coursework project focused on various aspects of machine learning and data processing. Each part addresses a unique problem statement and employs different methodologies.

Part 1: Anomaly Detection
Objective: Identify anomalies in housing data.
Tools Used: Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
Dataset: houses.csv.
Techniques: Explored data using Python dataframes, identified outliers and anomalies in the dataset.

Part 2: Data Imputation
Objective: Implement data imputation on a dataset with missing values.
Methods Used: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).
Analysis: Comparison of the imputation results from different methods.
Additional Techniques: Linear regression to assess the effectiveness of the imputation methods.

Part 3: Image Quality Enhancement
Objective: Enhance the quality of a set of images.
Approach: Iterative algorithm to improve image quality.
Dataset: A zip file of images.
Implementation: Python scripts to process and enhance the image quality over multiple iterations.
